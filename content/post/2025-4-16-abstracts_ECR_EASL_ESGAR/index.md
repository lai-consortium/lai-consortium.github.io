We’re excited that three abstracts highlighting the aim of the Liver Artificial Intelligence (LAI) consortium have been accepted for presentation at leading international conferences in 2025:
- European Congress of Radiology (ECR) 2025 – Vienna
- European Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology (ESGAR) 2025 – Amsterdam
- European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) 2025 – Amsterdam

These abstracts showcase the goals of the LAI consortium, including our work on building a diverse, multi-center MRI dataset and advancing AI methods for the diagnosis of solid-appearing liver lesions on MRI.
