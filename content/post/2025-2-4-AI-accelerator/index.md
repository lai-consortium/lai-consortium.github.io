On January 23, 2025, Erasmus MC hosted the official launch of its AI Accelerator program, an initiative designed to foster an AI-driven community, enhance knowledge-sharing, shape AI policies, and develop the necessary technical infrastructure within the institution. The event brought together researchers, clinicians, and AI experts to discuss the role of artificial intelligence in advancing medical science and healthcare.

The LAI Consortium was invited to participate in the poster session, showcasing its work on leveraging AI for the diagnosis of solid-appearing liver lesions on MRI. Our consortium is dedicated to accelerating the development, validation, and clinical implementation of machine learning methods in medical imaging. A key aspect of our work is the collaborative collection of imaging and clinical data from 12 centers across Europe, the United States, and Australia. By combining data and expertise from multiple institutions, we aim to develop robust and clinically relevant AI applications that can improve patient outcomes.

The AI Accelerator kick-off provided an excellent opportunity to engage with the broader AI and medical community, exchange ideas, and explore potential collaborations. As AI continues to shape the future of radiology and healthcare, initiatives like the Erasmus MC AI Accelerator and the LAI Consortium play a crucial role in ensuring AI innovations are both impactful and responsibly integrated into clinical practice.
