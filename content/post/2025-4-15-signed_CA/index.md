The Liver Artificial Intelligence (LAI) consortium has officially finalized and signed its consortium agreement, marking a major step forward in its mission to improve MRI-based diagnosis of liver lesions with AI.

The LAI Consortium brings together leading hospitals and research centers across three continents to create a benchmark MRI dataset of over 3,000 patients with pathologically confirmed liver lesions. This dataset will support the development and validation of AI tools to assist in the diagnosis of solid-appearing liver lesions on MRI.

By partnering with diverse institutions and including a wide range of patient profiles, liver diseases, and imaging equipment, the consortium aims to ensure that the resulting AI tools are robust and globally applicable.

Our current partners are:

- Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, The Netherlands 
- Academisch Ziekenhuis Maastricht, The Netherlands 
- University Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands 
- University Medical Center Groningen, The Netherlands 
- Stichting Amsterdam UMC, The Netherlands 
- Assistance Publique – Hôpitaux de Paris, France 
- Università Di Pisa, Italy 
- Università Degli Studi Di Palermo, Italy 
- Institute Jules Bordet, Belgium 
- Medical University of Gdansk, Poland 
- Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, United States of America
- Austin Health, Australia
