Establishing a Framework for Multicenter Liver Lesion Data Collection

<!--more-->

In May 2025, we held our first in-person LAI Consortium meeting during the ESGAR conference in Amsterdam. It was a valuable opportunity to meet face-to-face, strengthen collaborations, and align on the next steps of the project.

The meeting focused primarily on the practical aspects of data collection across participating centers. This marks a critical step toward building the LAI dataset â€” a large, publicly available benchmark MRI dataset consisting of over 3,000 patients with pathologically confirmed liver lesion phenotypes. The dataset will serve as a robust foundation for the development and validation of AI tools that aim to support radiologists in diagnosing solid-appearing liver lesions on MRI.

We are grateful to all attendees for their active participation and insightful contributions. We look forward to continued collaboration as we move closer to our shared goal of advancing AI-assisted liver imaging.
