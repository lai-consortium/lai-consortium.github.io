abstract: 'Rationale and Objectives Distinguishing malignant from benign liver lesions
  based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important but often challenging
  task, especially in noncirrhotic livers. We developed and externally validated a
  radiomics model to quantitatively assess T2-weighted MRI to distinguish the most
  common malignant and benign primary solid liver lesions in noncirrhotic livers.
  Materials and Methods Data sets were retrospectively collected from three tertiary
  referral centers (A, B, and C) between 2002 and 2018. Patients with malignant (hepatocellular
  carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma) and benign (hepatocellular adenoma
  and focal nodular hyperplasia) lesions were included. A radiomics model based on
  T2-weighted MRI was developed in data set A using a combination of machine learning
  approaches. The model was internally evaluated on data set A through cross-validation,
  externally validated on data sets B and C, and compared to visual scoring of two
  experienced abdominal radiologists on data set C. Results The overall data set included
  486 patients (A: 187, B: 98, and C: 201). The radiomics model had a mean area under
  the curve (AUC) of 0.78 upon internal validation on data set A and a similar AUC
  in external validation (B: 0.74 and C: 0.76). In data set C, the two radiologists
  showed moderate agreement (Cohen’s κ: 0.61) and achieved AUCs of 0.86 and 0.82.
  Conclusion Our T2-weighted MRI radiomics model shows potential for distinguishing
  malignant from benign primary solid liver lesions. External validation indicated
  that the model is generalizable despite substantial MRI acquisition protocol differences.
  Pending further optimization and generalization, this model may aid radiologists
  in improving the diagnostic workup of patients with liver lesions.'
