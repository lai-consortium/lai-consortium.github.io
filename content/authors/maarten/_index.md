# Biography
He obtained his medical degree in 1996 at the Catholic University of Leuven, followed by a radiology residency split between the University Hospital of Leuven and Sint-Jans Hospital in Brussels. Since 2002, he has served as a staff physician in abdominal radiology at Erasmus MC and earned a PhD in 2018. He leads MRI sequence optimization for abdominal protocols and has been a member of the research board of the Dutch Benign Liver Tumor Group (DBLTG) since 2017, as well as a member of LECO (monitoring committee for colorectal cancer screening) since 2012.
 
He co-founded and serves as a principal investigator in the international LAI consortium (Liver Artificial Intelligence). Since 2020, he has represented the Dutch Society of Radiology (NVVR) for national guidelines on cervical, endometrial, and ovarian cancer. In 2022, he shared his expertise through a series of educational webinars on MRI liver tumor evaluation, now freely accessible on platforms like YouTube.
 
In 2018, he organized the first two-day Liver MRI workshop in Rotterdam, gathering experts to explore the latest advances in liver imaging, with a follow-up workshop planned for fall 2025. He has been awarded several grants, including the KWF Research Grant (2023), NWO-TTW Grant (2023), and Nuts Ohra Grant (2012).
